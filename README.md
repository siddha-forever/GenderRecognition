# Gender Recognition App

This MATLAB app performs real-time gender identification using audio recordings. It uses various signal processing techniques to analyze the frequency of the voice and determine whether the speaker is male or female.

## Features

1. **Record Audio**: Record a 5-second audio clip using your microphone.
2. **Remove Noise**: Reduce noise from the recorded audio using spectral subtraction.
3. **Generate Graph**: Plot the audio waveform.
4. **Listen to Audio**: Play back the recorded audio.
5. **Calculate Gender**: Identify the gender based on the pitch of the audio.
6. **Execute**: Load an audio file and prepare it for processing.
7. **Reset**: Clear the current data and reset the app.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB
- MATLAB App Designer
- Signal Processing Toolbox

## Components

The app window will appear with the following components: <br/>
	•	Record: Start recording audio. <br/>
	•	Stop: Stop the audio playback.  <br/>
	•	Listen Audio: Play the recorded audio.  <br/>
	•	Remove Noise: Reduce noise from the recorded audio.  <br/>
